# OpenWeatherMap API Application in PHP

This repository written in PHP that allows you to check the weather for a particular location using the OpenWeatherMap API 2.5. The app can determine your location by IP address and show the weather information, or you can enter the name of any city yourself.

## Installation

You can install the library using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Simply add the following lines to your `composer.json` file and run `composer install`:

```json
"require": {
    "scrnr/weather": "*"
}
```

Or you can used the **command**:

```bash
composer require scrnr/weather
```

## How to use

To use this app, you'll need to obtain an **API key** from the [OpenWeatherMap website](https://openweathermap.org/api) and set it using the `setToken()` function. The `setToken()` function accepts a token in string format.

Once you've set your **API key**, you can retrieve weather data using the `getWeather()` function. This function accepts two parameters: `CITY_NAME` and `UNITS_OF_MEASUREMENT`.

* `CITY_NAME` accepts the name of the city in string format
* `UNITS_OF_MEASUREMENT` accepts either `Units::METRIC` or `Units::IMPERIAL` as constants to specify the units of measurement.

If you do not set these parameters, the function will automatically determine the city based on the *IP address* and use the *metric system* as the *default* units of measurement.

If the `getWeather()` function returns false, you can use the `getErrors()` function to retrieve information about the error. This will allow you to troubleshoot any issues that may have occurred during the process.

Thank you for using my OpenWeatherMap API Application!

## For example:

```php
use Scrnr\Weather\Weather;

Weather::setToken('YOUR_TOKEN');
$forecast = Weather::getWeather('CITY_NAME', 'UNITS');

if ($forecast === false) {
    $errors = Weather::getErrors();
}
```
